# Part III Data Infrastructure Layer

## Goals of this part

Part III explains the data foundation that enterprise Agents rely on before they can answer, analyze, or act. It covers ingestion, lakehouse storage, OLAP engines, streaming data, orchestration, quality, metadata, lineage, contracts, and metrics. The focus is on making data queryable, traceable, permission-aware, and recoverable for DataAgent and other platform capabilities.

## Chapters in This Part

- [Chapter 10 Data Ingestion and Integration](ch10.md) - CDC, Debezium, Airbyte, Fivetran, Flink CDC; Batch vs. Streaming
- [Chapter 11 Data Lakes and Lakehouses](ch11.md) - S3/HDFS, Iceberg, Hudi, Delta, Paimon; ACID, Time Travel
- [Chapter 12 Lakehouse Engines and OLAP](ch12-olap.md) - Doris, StarRocks, Trino, ClickHouse, DuckDB
- [Chapter 13 Stream Processing and Real-Time Data](ch13.md) - Flink, Spark Streaming, Kafka; Exactly-Once, Watermark
- [Chapter 14 Data Orchestration and Quality](ch14.md) - Airflow, Dagster, Prefect; Great Expectations, Soda, dbt tests
- [Chapter 15 Metadata, Lineage, Contracts, and Metrics](ch15.md) - DataHub, OpenLineage, Data Contract, Cube, MetricFlow, Feast

## Reading path

Read Chapters 10 to 15 in order if you are building the full data foundation. Readers already familiar with lakehouse systems can skim Chapters 10 to 12 and focus on Chapters 14 to 15, where quality state, metadata, contracts, and metric definitions connect directly to DataAgent behavior.
