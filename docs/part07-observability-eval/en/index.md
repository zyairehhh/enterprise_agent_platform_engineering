# Part VII Observability, Evaluation, and Cost

## Objectives of This Section

This section addresses a high-risk set of questions for an enterprise-grade Agent platform moving from "just running" to "operational excellence": How to understand why an Agent succeeds or fails, whether online quality is improving, if costs are controllable, and whether the system can withstand real business traffic.

Observability, evaluation, cost governance, and SLOs are more than add-ons after launch; they form the production foundation of an Agent platform. Without tracing, it is impossible to review a multi-step task execution; without evaluation, it is impossible to judge if changes in models, prompts, tools, or data cause regressions; without cost and resilience governance, Agents can easily spiral out of control during long-running tasks, high concurrency, or uncertain inference.

## Recommended Reading Paths

- **Platform Leaders / CTOs**: Focus on the observability closed loop in Chapter 38, evaluation systems in Chapters 39-40, and cost & SLO trade-offs in Chapters 41-42.
- **Architects**: Read the entire section, with emphasis on trace data models, evaluation platform architecture, online experimentation, cache hierarchy, and stability strategies.
- **Engineers**: Read the full section and align with engineering implementations in `mini-platform/core/observability/`, `mini-platform/core/eval/`, and `mini-platform/core/gateway/`.
- **Data Intelligence Teams**: Focus on Chapters 39-40 to establish DataAgent offline benchmarks, online feedback, and continuous regression mechanisms.
