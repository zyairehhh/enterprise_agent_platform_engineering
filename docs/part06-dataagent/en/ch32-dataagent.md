# Chapter 32 DataAgent Product Forms

---

## Scene Introduction Part V established the operational foundation of the Agent platform: the Runtime handles the six states of running and checkpointing, the Registry manages tool registration and call auditing, the Planner determines the next tool to use, the Memory stores multi-turn context, and HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) pauses high-risk tasks awaiting human confirmation. Entering Part VI, the question becomes: how do these capabilities combine to form a data product tailored for business users?

This book calls such products DataAgents. They run on top of the Agent platform, serving business scenarios in operations, finance, supply chain, marketing, and more, helping users initiate data queries, analyses, and reporting tasks via natural language. They are not Gateways, not semantic layers, nor just SQL plugins. They are business Agents that link natural language questions, semantic layers, SQL execution, Python analysis, charts, reports, and audit workflows into one chain.

We can start from a common question: "Sales in East China dropped sharply last week compared to the previous week. What are the main SKUs? Is there a connection with category structure?" If only NL2SQL is done, the system might generate a SQL query to find the top SKUs. But a true DataAgent must first determine whether "sales" refers to operational GMV or financial GMV, confirm which organizational level "East China" corresponds to, decide whether to first query SKUs then use Python to analyze category contribution, and explain data timestamp, metric versions, and evidence sources in the answer. When the user then asks "What about North China?", the system should reuse the previous time frame, metrics, and comparison method, only changing the region.

This boundary becomes visible in real operating meetings. A pilot system may quickly return a Top SKU table and executable SQL, yet the meeting can still fail if two of the SKUs belong to a clearance strategy, the controller expects operational GMV while the query used a finance metric, or the region hierarchy changed during the week. The SQL can be valid while the business conclusion is unusable.

DataAgent must therefore complete a data task instead of produce a fluent answer. It identifies whether the user is querying or diagnosing, binds metrics and organization scope, decides whether multi-step analysis is needed, keeps evidence after execution, and delivers an explanation that business users can adopt. Chapters 33 through 36 develop the chain: semantic layer, NL2SQL, Text-to-Python, visualization, and reporting.

## 32.1 DataAgent Covers the Full Data Task Chain

NL2SQL is one of the core capabilities of DataAgent. Without the ability to convert natural language questions into executable queries, DataAgent would struggle to enable self-service analytics. However, NL2SQL alone is not enough. The most common failures in enterprise analytics are not SQL syntax errors, but mistakes in business definitions, permission boundaries, loss of context, or conclusions unsupported by evidence.

Public Text-to-SQL benchmarks typically provide the question and database schema and evaluate the correctness of the generated SQL. Benchmarks like Spider, BIRD, and Spider 2.0 have driven improvements in NL2SQL capabilities, but enterprise scenarios add layers such as semantic modeling, access control, versioned business logic, multi-turn clarifications, and evidence presentation. A model that performs well on benchmarks mainly shows it can write SQL well, but that does not prove it can reliably answer business questions within an enterprise data ecosystem.

*Table 32-1: Differences Between Pure NL2SQL and Production-Grade DataAgent. Source: Compiled by the author.*

| Stage           | Pure NL2SQL               | Production-Grade DataAgent                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Question Understanding | Model guesses fields and metrics directly | First construct a Question Frame                 |
| Business Logic Binding   | Depends on prompt instructions     | Bind to semantic layer metrics and their versions |
| Execution       | Generate SQL and run directly    | Through Registry, Policy, and read-only executor |
| Multi-turn Follow-up | Re-interpret question at each turn | Working Memory reuses confirmed context           |
| Complex Analysis  | Try to fit everything into one SQL | SQL fetches data, then analyze in a Python sandbox |
| Delivery        | Return numbers or tables        | Generate charts and reports with EvidenceRef      |

DataAgent can be viewed as three layers of capabilities stacked together. The first layer is the query loop: understanding the question, generating queries, executing them, and interpreting the results. The second layer is the analysis loop: performing statistics, decomposition, comparison and attribution on query results. The third layer is the delivery loop: organizing results into charts, reports, approval records, and replayable artifacts. NL2SQL covers only a portion of the first layer.

DataAgent also cannot bypass the data platform. Metric definitions, data freshness, lineage, permissions, and anonymization still come from the data platform and semantic layer; the Agent platform handles runtime, tool invocation, auditing, and recovery; DataAgent applications handle question understanding, task classification, report templates, and domain policies. When these three are clearly separated, the system can function as both a product and a scalable production solution.

This boundary also determines how failures are handled. If NL2SQL writes a faulty SQL, the planner can fix or regenerate it; if the semantic layer cannot find a metric, the system clarifies or refuses the answer; if permissions prohibit detail access, it returns aggregates or permission warnings; if data freshness is insufficient, the system annotates the answer or pauses report generation. These are product flow issues, not problems solvable by "model thinking harder."

Therefore, the initial version of DataAgent should not try to "answer everything." A more reasonable goal is to reliably manage metrics and business logic, query execution, evidence presentation, and multi-turn Q&A within a clear domain. Users would rather see "this metric requires business confirmation" than an unsupported but fluent number.
## 32.2 ChatBI, BI Copilot, and DataAgent

In the industry, the term "conversational data querying" is often called ChatBI, but the engineering boundaries of different product forms vary greatly. ChatBI typically focuses on natural language querying, with an emphasis on converting user questions into reports or query results. BI Copilot is embedded within existing BI products to help users modify filters, adjust charts, and explain the current dashboard. DataAgent runs on a general-purpose Agent platform and can complete data tasks across data sources, tools, and approval workflows.

*Table 32-2: Boundaries of three product forms. Source: compiled by the author.*

| Form          | Typical Interaction           | Data Scope          | Platform Relation           | Suitable Scenarios                      |
|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ChatBI        | Query data via chat window   | Single database or subject | Often a standalone tool    | Lightweight self-service querying      |
| BI Copilot    | Modify visuals, explain reports within BI | Current report or dataset | Attached to BI product      | Efficiency enhancement for existing BI users |
| DataAgent     | Data task-oriented Agent      | Semantic layer, multi-source, permission context | Shares Runtime, Registry, Trace | Querying, analysis, reporting, and approvals |

The advantage of BI Copilot is its closeness to existing reports. Users do not need to leave the dashboard to ask questions such as "Why did this chart drop?" or "Change to category display." Its boundary is also clear: the context is usually restricted to the current report or dataset. Cross-theme standard governance, long-running task orchestration, and multi-Agent approval are not its primary responsibilities.

DataAgent functions more like an entry point for data tasks. It can start from natural language, invoke the semantic layer and SQL tools, use a Python sandbox if needed, and ultimately generate a report for approval. It does not replace BI or data modeling. A more reasonable relationship is that formal metric dashboards remain within BI, while DataAgent handles exploratory querying, temporary analyses, and report drafts; once analysis results stabilize, they are condensed back into BI datasets or reports.

This boundary is important for product roadmaps. If a company only has a single-subject data set, starting with ChatBI or BI Copilot may be faster. If the goal is cross-business domain operational analysis with auditing, approvals, and multi-step tasks, DataAgent is a more suitable form.

When evaluating products, whether for procurement or in-house development, three questions can quickly judge the true product boundaries. First, can the metrics in responses be traced back to semantic layer versions? Second, can the execution process be replayed down to SQL, parameters, and permission contexts? Third, does multi-turn querying reuse structured frames instead of feeding chat history back into the model? Systems unable to answer these questions resemble conversational BI plugins instead of a platform-level DataAgent.

## 32.3 Four Product Forms

This book divides DataAgent product forms into four tiers: Questioning, Analysis, Reporting, and Task Workbench. They are not four mutually exclusive SKUs but a maturity progression. Most enterprises should first make the Questioning form reliable, then add Analysis and Reporting, and finally solidify high-frequency workflows into a Task Workbench.

*Table 32-3: Four DataAgent Product Forms. Source: compiled by this book.*

| Form           | User Demand                        | Typical Output              | Core Dependencies                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Questioning    | "What was East China's GMV last week?" | Tables, numbers, brief explanations | Semantic layer, NL2SQL, read-only SQL      |
| Analysis       | "Which categories mainly caused the decline?" | Decomposition, contribution, statistical summaries | SQL data retrieval, Python sandbox           |
| Reporting      | "A review report for the business meeting" | Charts, insights, draft reports | EvidenceRef, chart rendering, templates     |
| Task Workbench | "Automatically generate and submit monthly" | Replayable run chains, approval records | Runtime, HITL, multi-Agent handoff           |

The Questioning form is the easiest foundation to verify. It requires the semantic layer to bind business terms to metrics, NL2SQL to generate correct queries, the executor to safely return results, and the answer to explain definitions and data time frames. Without this step, jumping directly to reports tends to package erroneous numbers more attractively.

The Analysis form introduces Python or dedicated analysis services. Many problems cannot be solved by a single SQL query, such as structural contribution, anomaly detection, simple forecasting, and price-sales decomposition. DataAgent should first retrieve controlled data via SQL, then pass intermediate results into sandbox analysis instead of asking the model to compute inside the prompt. The Reporting form requires evidence references. Every number, trend, and conclusion in reports should link back to query results, chart data, or analysis artifacts. Otherwise, the smoother the narrative language, the greater the risk. Chapter 36 will focus on organizing EvidenceRef, charts, and storytelling.

The Task Workbench is the mature form. It turns DataAgent from a one-off Q&A into an operational workflow, such as weekly business briefs, monthly reviews, anomaly attribution, and approval submission. At this stage, run checkpoints, approvals, scheduled tasks, multi-Agent collaboration, and trace replay all become part of the product.

The pace of advancing through these four forms should obey the maturity of the data foundation. If the semantic layer covers only a few core metrics, starting with Questioning is more suitable; if query results are stable but business requires secondary processing, Analysis with Python can be added; if report templates and evidence referencing are stable, move to Reporting; only when reporting workflows repeat frequently is it worthwhile to build scheduling, approval, and the Task Workbench. Conversely, if the semantic layer is unstable but the system jumps directly to automated monthly reports, it amplifies definition issues into organizational problems.

---

## 32.4 Question Frame and Task Planning

Before generating SQL, DataAgent should first convert the user's question into a Question Frame. This is not text shown to the user but rather a contract between the Planner, semantic layer, Memory, and execution tools. A typical Frame includes metrics, dimensions, time, subject, task type, granularity, and execution path.

```yaml
intent: diagnose
metrics: [gmv]
dimensions:
  region: EAST
time:
  primary: last_week
  compare_to: prior_week
grain: sku
task_type: diagnose
path: sql_then_python
semantic_view: sales_ops
```

The above Frame is still not the final SQL. The `metrics: [gmv]` is just a token at the user's natural language level; Chapter 33's semantic layer Linker will bind it to a specific `metric_id@version`. The `path: sql_then_python` indicates fetching data by SQL first, then performing category contribution or structural analysis in Python. This structured intermediate layer allows the system to carry forward context over multiple rounds of questioning and also to continue execution after checkpoint recovery.

*Table 32-4: Task Types and Preferred Paths. Source: Compiled by the author.*

| Task Type | User Query Example           | Preferred Path                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Query     | "East China GMV last week"  | Semantic layer + NL2SQL         |
| Compare   | "Year-over-year for East and North China" | SQL aggregation or multi-column query |
| Diagnose  | "Which SKUs caused the decline?" | SQL data retrieval + Python decomposition |
| Attribution | "Was price or sales volume the cause?" | Python contribution analysis   |
| Report    | "Write a business review report" | Analysis results + charts + templates |

The Question Frame also determines if follow-up clarification is needed. If time, metrics, or subject are missing, the system cannot pretend it understands. If both operational GMV and financial GMV exist in the semantic layer, and the user does not specify context, DataAgent can use a role-based default but must state metric title and version explicitly in the answer. If defaults are insufficient to support a conclusion, the system should enter clarification.

![Figure 32-1: Planner Path Selection](../../images/part6/en/ch32-planner-flow.png)

*Figure 32-1: Planner Path Selection. Source: Author's illustration. Alt text: Decision tree branches based on question types directing to NL2SQL, multi-step analysis, Text-to-Python paths.*

The Frame must enter Working Memory and checkpoints. When the user asks, "What about North China then?" the system should inherit metric, time, and comparison baselines, only replacing the region. After a Pod restart, the Runtime should also restore to the same Frame. Otherwise, DataAgent will degrade into independent single-turn chats where numbers and scopes easily drift.

The Frame can also reduce front-end complexity. The front end does not need to understand all metrics and table structures; it only passes user input, clarification answers, and display preferences to DataAgent. DataAgent maintains the Frame in the background, deciding whether to continue clarifying, fetch data, analyze, or generate reports. This way, the user experience preserves a natural language input while engineering relies on a structured contract.

For operational users, the Frame's presence should not feel like a form burden. The system can ask a brief clarification question when needed, such as "For sales amount here, do you mean operational GMV or financial GMV?" Once the user confirms, subsequent similar queries can reduce repeated clarifications by applying user profiles or organizational defaults. Human-computer interaction requires restraint: ask when necessary, use explainable defaults otherwise.

---

## 32.5 Composite Scenario of Business Analysis

Part VI uses an anonymized business analysis scenario to run through each chapter. Before the weekly meeting, the operations lead needs to explain the sales decline in the East China region; the financial controller needs to verify the metric definitions; and the category manager wants to review structural changes. DataAgent is responsible for breaking down the problem into executable workflows.

*Table 32-5: Mapping of East China Decline Scenario to Part VI Chapters. Source: Compiled by the authors.*

| Step        | Chapter   | Key Action               | Output                  |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Problem Modeling | Chapter 32 | Generate Question Frame    | `task_type=diagnose`     |
| Metric Binding   | Chapter 33 | Schema Linking and Disambiguation | `gmv_ops@2025Q1`        |
| Query Execution  | Chapter 34 | Compile and Execute Read-Only SQL | Top SKU results          |
| Analytical Computation | Chapter 35 | Python Category Contribution Calculation | `category_contrib.json`  |
| Report Generation | Chapter 36 | Organize Charts and Insights | EvidenceRef report       |
| Manual Review    | Chapter 30 | Controller Approval       | `waiting_human` to `approve` |

A successful SSE event for a question can remain consistent with Chapter 22. The frontend may first receive `state=running`, then `action=sql_executor`, followed by `result` and the final `state=succeeded`. DataAgent can present business answers on top of these platform events but should not invent a separate set of state names detached from the runtime.

User-visible answers must include evidence information. For example: "East China operational GMV fell 12.3% compared to the previous week, mainly from three SKUs. The metric used is operational GMV `gmv_ops@2025Q1`, with data as of 2025-06-14 06:00." This statement does not need to expose every SQL query but must make clear which metric definition was used, data freshness, and which query the conclusion came from.

This scenario also demonstrates DataAgent's failure handling paths. If the semantic layer lacks "operational GMV," the system should pause for clarification or refuse to answer; if SQL execution times out, the task should return failure while preserving the trace; if Python analysis finds insufficient sample size, the conclusion confidence should be downgraded; if the report is to be sent externally, it should enter HITL (Human-In-The-Loop). Clearly defining failure paths prevents the product from degenerating into simply "model-generated fabricated explanations" during exceptional cases.

---

## 32.6 Boundaries with Data Platforms, BI, and Agent Platforms

DataAgent operates at the business application layer, reusing capabilities from the data platform and agent platform below. Clear boundaries are essential so that the system does not become technical debt after early successful demos.

![Figure 32-2: Boundary between DataAgent and Platform Layers](../../images/part6/en/ch32-platform-layers.png)

*Figure 32-2: Boundary between DataAgent and platform layers. Source: author's illustration. Alt text: The layered diagram distinguishes DataAgent's exclusive capabilities from platform shared capabilities, arrows indicate DataAgent reuses platform features instead of rebuilding them.*

The Agent platform provides Runtime, Registry, Trace, HITL (Human-in-the-Loop), and Policy components. DataAgent should not replicate its own execution state management or tool call chains. SQL executors, Python sandboxes, and chart renderers should be invoked as Registry tools so that other agents can reuse them and audits can be unified.

The data platform provides lakehouse, OLAP, metadata, data quality, freshness, and semantic layers. DataAgent can consume these capabilities but should avoid long-term direct access to ODS physical tables. Direct access may seem faster initially but will incur higher costs later in terms of consistency, permissions, lineage, and data quality.

BI remains valuable. Fixed dashboards, formal financial reports, and high-frequency metric monitoring are suitable to remain in the BI layer. DataAgent better serves exploratory queries, ad hoc analysis, draft reports, and multi-turn tasks. Both share the semantic layer to avoid having two different definitions for the same metric in BI and DataAgent.

This also means DataAgent projects should not be completed by a frontend or modeling team alone. The data platform team must provide metrics and quality metadata, the agent platform team must provide runtime and tool governance, and the business team must provide terminology, default definitions, and reporting templates. Without any party, the product will suffer distortions at some stage: the model may write SQL but be inconsistent in definitions, or the definitions may be accurate but the user experience will feel like an internal tool.

---

## 32.7 Product Success Criteria

The success of DataAgent cannot be judged solely by SQL exact match rates. Enterprise users ultimately care about trustworthiness, usability, and governance. Trustworthiness means data definitions are accurate, evidence is traceable, and permissions are properly controlled; usability means business users are willing to repeatedly use the system, with acceptable latency and interaction costs; governance means every answer can be replayed with the Run, SQL, metric versions, approval chains, and artifacts intact.

In the initial phase, accuracy can be prioritized. The system should ask clarifying questions when slots are missing, refuse to answer when the semantic layer is unavailable, and send high-risk reports for manual confirmation. This approach may reduce first-question resolution rates but helps establish trust. During the proof-of-concept phase, coverage can be moderately expanded, but it is high-risk to label which results have not gone through the semantic layer or manual review. Pilot strategies must not be carried into production.

After going live, metrics should be analyzed by roles. Business users focus on first-question resolution rates, multi-turn completion rates, and readability of answers; data owners focus on semantic layer coverage, metric versions, and lineage visibility; platform owners focus on cost per Run, tool reuse, and error recovery; compliance and internal audit focus on permission violations, approval records, and trace completeness. Only when all these metrics improve together can DataAgent be considered operationally mature.

Success criteria must also be phased. During the querying phase, focus on definition consistency, SQL success rates, and refusal quality; in the analysis phase, add reproducibility of artifacts and Python sandbox security; in the reporting phase, add citation rate of evidence and manual rollback rates; in the task workbench phase, add scheduled task success rates, approval times, and exception recovery. Pressuring all metrics into the first release scatters focus and weakens the team.

Finally, beware of a product pitfall: misunderstanding that "users like natural language input" means "users do not care about evidence." Business users can accept natural language interaction with the system, but for high-risk numbers, they still require consistent definitions, data timestamps, and traceable sources. DataAgent's trust comes from evidence, not from the tone of the answer.

## 32.8 DataAgent Capability Release Path

DataAgent should not be released as a broad assistant that can answer every data question. A safer path opens capabilities layer by layer, with an entry condition and rollback path for each layer. The first layer is read-only querying over core metrics and stable datasets covered by the semantic layer. The second layer is controlled analysis, where Python or a dedicated analysis tool operates only on authorized query results. The third layer is report generation, where every conclusion requires EvidenceRef. The fourth layer is the task workbench, where scheduling, approval, review, and multi-Agent collaboration become part of the product workflow.

Each layer has a different release standard. Read-only querying cares about metric binding, SQL correctness, permission refusal, and refusal quality. Controlled analysis adds sample size, analysis code, numeric validation, and artifact audit. Report generation adds evidence citation, language strength, manual rejection, and version management. Task workbench adds Run recovery, HITL duration, failure compensation, and operating metrics. Mixing these standards makes the first release hard to judge.

The release path must allow downgrade. If a reporting scenario shows falling evidence citation or rising manual rejection, it can return to the analysis form. If Python artifacts cannot be reproduced, the scenario can return to read-only querying. If the semantic layer does not cover a topic, the topic should remain internal or experimental. Product maturity should follow evidence strength, not a one-way automation ladder.

## 32.9 Typical Failure Modes and Product Degradation

DataAgent failures usually cross multiple layers. The user may omit a definition, the semantic layer may not cover a metric, NL2SQL may generate executable but wrong SQL, Python analysis may lack enough samples, a report may state a conclusion more strongly than the evidence supports, or the reviewer may not have enough context to approve. Product design should convert these failures into understandable states instead of a generic system error.

When a metric definition is missing, the system should ask a clarification question and write the result back into the Question Frame. When the semantic layer lacks coverage, the answer should explain the unsupported metric and suggest available definitions. SQL failures should distinguish permission denial, resource limits, missing fields, and empty data. Python failures can downgrade to query results plus a cautious explanation. Reports with weak evidence can be generated as restricted drafts instead of formal conclusions.

Degradation preserves the trusted scope when evidence is insufficient. A DataAgent that returns controlled query results is more production-ready than one that produces a full report without traceable evidence. This chapter sets the degradation principle; Chapters 33 through 36 apply it to semantic binding, query execution, analysis artifacts, and reports.

## 32.10 Integration with Organizational Processes

DataAgent is used by business people, so it has to enter business processes instead of remain a chat box. Operating reviews, finance retrospectives, supply chain incidents, and marketing campaign evaluations already have metric definitions, review responsibilities, and publication paths. Before DataAgent enters those processes, the team must define who can ask, who can see detail, who confirms definitions, who publishes reports, and who resolves disputes.

Organizational context also defines defaults. The same "sales" question may use one definition in an operations meeting, another in finance closing, and a different period in sales daily reporting. The same regional manager may view detail for her own region but only aggregates elsewhere. DataAgent should read user role, business domain, default metric policy, and permission policy before handing the task to model planning and execution. The model turns a question into a task; the platform decides whether that task may run.

The first version should go deep in one process. A weekly operating review, for example, can cover pre-meeting querying, anomaly attribution, report draft, controller review, and post-meeting issue capture. The scope is narrower than a universal data question box, but it validates the full chain: Question Frame, semantic layer, SQL, Python, reporting, HITL, and Trace. A narrow process often produces a more stable product because the system knows which metrics are core, which dimensions can be drilled into, which conclusions need review, and which reports are only drafts.

Process integration also affects delivery format. Operating meetings need charts and action items suitable for meeting material; finance reviews need auditable definitions and approval records; supply chain incidents need owners, causes, and follow-up tasks. DataAgent should deliver results to report drafts, task boards, approval flows, meeting material, or BI saved views as appropriate. Compressing all output into chat bubbles makes it hard for users to put the result into daily work.

## 32.11 First-Version MVP Scope Control

The first DataAgent release can fail by being too broad. Natural language input makes business stakeholders expect all data questions to work. If the platform tries to satisfy that expectation immediately, definition, permission, and performance problems will dominate the work. The MVP should choose one business domain, a small set of core metrics, a stable dimension set, and a clear task chain. A weekly operating review over sales, orders, inventory, and category structure is a better first target than finance closing, customer service quality, and supply chain dispatching at the same time.

Scope should be visible in the product boundary. Supported metrics, default time grain, accessible roles, data freshness, report types, and actions requiring human review should be clear before launch. For out-of-scope questions, the system should explain the current boundary and offer supported alternatives. Letting the model improvise increases apparent coverage in demos but weakens trust in production. Refusal quality is part of the MVP.

The MVP should also control automation depth. The first release can send report drafts to review instead of publishing automatically, return candidate Python conclusions instead of writing decisions, and keep multi-Agent collaboration mostly behind the scenes. Automation should increase as the evidence chain and operating metrics become stronger. First-question resolution rate alone is a poor success metric if the system improves it by asking fewer clarifying questions, hiding freshness, or weakening permission prompts. A better metric set includes completion rate for core questions, correctness of high-risk definitions, manual rejection reasons, evidence completeness, and repeat usage.

## 32.12 DataAgent Acceptance Samples

Acceptance samples should come from real business questions. Deriving questions only from database schema produces clean but artificial samples. The sample set should cover simple querying, multi-turn follow-up, metric disambiguation, permission refusal, empty data, query timeout, Python analysis, report generation, and human review. Each sample needs an expected behavior: answer, clarify, refuse, degrade, or transfer to human review.

Review the process as well as the final text. The team should check whether the Question Frame is correct, semantic binding is correct, SQL is read-only and permission constrained, Python artifacts are reproducible, report conclusions have EvidenceRef, and Trace can replay key steps. A fluent answer with a wrong Frame should fail. A short answer with clear evidence and boundary may be production-grade.

These samples become the shared baseline for Chapters 33 through 38. Semantic layer changes should run them. NL2SQL releases should run them. Python sandbox policy changes should run them. Report template updates should run them. DataAgent quality comes from the full chain continuing to pass, while a single module metric only describes one local condition.

Acceptance samples should also include organizational roles. An operations owner, regional manager, finance controller, and data platform engineer may see different data levels, default definitions, and actions for the same question. Testing only with an administrator account misses permission pruning, default policy, and wording differences. Samples should keep business context: user role, meeting scenario, metric version, accessible View, expected clarification, and expected deliverable. Without that context, a regression test may only prove that the system can generate similar prose.

Sample maintenance belongs to operations. Online disputes, manual rejections, and user edits should become new samples. Obsolete metrics, retired organization definitions, and removed report templates should move out of the default regression set or be marked as historical samples. A useful sample library supports both historical replay and current release decisions.

## 32.13 DataAgent Release Ledger and Operating Review

The DataAgent release ledger should be organized by capability layer instead of a single version label. Querying, analysis, reporting, and task workbench modes depend on different modules and require different evidence. The querying layer records semantic-layer version, SQL executor version, permission policy, and refusal samples. The analysis layer records Python sandbox policy, reproducible artifacts, sample-size boundaries, and numeric checks. The reporting layer records EvidenceRef coverage, template version, manual rejection reasons, and publication permission. The task workbench layer records Runtime, HITL, scheduled triggers, notifications, and task recovery. With this structure, a release record explains which capability was opened and which scenarios remain experimental.

Operating review should follow real task chains. A weekly business review task may pass through Question Frame, semantic binding, SQL query, Python analysis, chart generation, report draft, controller review, and meeting-material archival. Review should inspect more than whether the final answer reads well. Each stage needs evidence: whether the Frame carried role and default definition, whether SQL was read-only and hit the correct View, whether the Python artifact can be reproduced, whether report conclusions point to EvidenceRef, and whether HITL recorded the approved object and artifact hash. If any stage lacks evidence, future disputes return to manual explanation.

The release ledger also supports downgrade decisions. A scenario that performs well in querying is not automatically ready for automated reports. A report scenario with many manual rejections does not require shutting down the whole DataAgent. The safer response is to move that scenario back to the analysis layer, keep controlled query and analysis output, and pause automatic drafting or submission. If a query topic keeps being refused because the semantic layer lacks coverage, the product owner should put it into the next metric-building cycle instead of asking the model to bypass the semantic layer and query physical tables directly. The ledger ties capability level to evidence so the team can adjust locally.

Different roles need different review measures. Business owners care about completion rate for core questions, clarification count, and report usability. Data owners care about metric version, lineage, freshness, and definition disputes. Platform owners care about cost per Run, tool failure rate, recovery success rate, and queue waiting time. Compliance owners care about permission refusals, approval records, and export evidence. A single aggregate score hides these differences. DataAgent spans the data platform and the Agent platform, and its operating view has to be layered as well.

The first version can use a weekly review rhythm. Each week, sample successful tasks, downgraded tasks, manually rejected tasks, and user disputes, then inspect Frame, metric binding, SQL, analysis artifacts, EvidenceRef, HITL, and Trace with the same checklist. Review results should feed acceptance samples and the next release plan: scenarios with enough evidence can move to a higher capability layer, weak-evidence scenarios can downgrade, and repeated failures can return to the corresponding engineering module in later chapters. DataAgent then improves from production evidence instead of relying on demos or subjective impressions.

## 32.14 Admission Samples For The DataAgent End-To-End Chain

DataAgent construction should start from admission samples. A qualified sample needs more than a natural-language question. It should include user role, metric definition, accessible data domain, expected SQL or query path, correct conclusion, acceptable chart, evidence citation, and failure handling. If a sample only says "query this month's sales," the platform cannot judge whether semantic layer, permission, SQL, charting, and reporting work together. The more complete the admission sample is, the easier it is for Chapters 33 to 36 to align.

Admission samples should cover normal and abnormal paths. The normal path shows how the system enters the semantic layer, generates the query, executes computation, explains charts, and produces a report. The abnormal path states how to recover when the metric is missing, permission is insufficient, SQL fails, results are empty, the chart is unsuitable, EvidenceRef is missing, or human review rejects the answer. Samples with only happy paths make DataAgent look smooth in demos but leave it unable to handle incomplete inputs and disputed definitions in production.

The overall chain also needs cross-chapter evidence. After a sample passes, it should link model version, semantic-layer version, query log, execution plan, chart specification, report paragraph, Trace, Eval, and human review. Chapter 32 then becomes the admission entry for later chapters, with the architecture overview serving that acceptance role. Each new business domain should start by adding admission samples, then expanding semantic layer and tools, and finally entering reporting and evaluation.

## 32.15 Release communication for DataAgent capability boundaries

Before DataAgent goes live, product and platform teams should explain capability boundaries to users. Users need to know which questions can be answered directly, which questions produce drafts, which questions require human confirmation, and which questions are outside the current scope. Boundary communication should not read like a disclaimer. It should appear in task entry points, result pages, and review flows. A business-analysis entry point can state supported metric domains, data freshness, available dimensions, and approval requirements. A report-generation flow can mark which sections come from data queries and which sections require a business owner to revise.

Failure paths also need communication. DataAgent may stop because permission is missing, the semantic layer has no metric, SQL execution failed, evidence conflicts, or report review did not pass. If users see only a generic failure, they tend to blame the model. If they see the failing stage and the available action, they are more likely to accept platform governance. A message such as "the East China metric definition is missing; choose national scope or submit a metric request" is more useful than "query failed." Boundary communication helps users understand how the system completes work safely.

The first release can include a small set of supported and unsupported questions. Supported examples show task chains already covered by the platform. Unsupported examples show high-risk or low-evidence tasks that should wait. After every capability expansion, these examples should be updated. User expectation, evaluation samples, and product boundary then stay aligned as DataAgent moves from a demo capability to an operated enterprise service.

## 32.16 Change control and rollback strategy for DataAgent

DataAgent change control should be separated by chain segment. Model, Prompt, semantic layer, SQL executor, Python sandbox, report template, permission policy, and frontend component changes can all alter the user's result, but they introduce different risks. A model change may affect definition explanation and clarification behavior. A semantic-layer change affects metric binding. A report-template change affects expression strength and evidence display. A permission-policy change may alter the data scope visible to the same user. A release record that only says "DataAgent upgraded" gives the team little help when an incident appears.

Each change should bind to acceptance samples and an observation window. Semantic-layer changes should run core metric, permission refusal, empty result, and multi-turn follow-up samples. Report-template changes should run EvidenceRef, human review, and export-boundary samples. Python sandbox policy changes should run resource-limit, non-whitelisted package, and numeric-validation samples. After samples pass, the change can enter canary release. During canary, the platform should record old/new differences, user feedback, manual rejections, and cost movement.

Rollback should also be layered. Model routing can return to the previous model. A metric can return to the prior semantic version. Report templates can pause automatic publication. Python analysis can degrade to read-only querying. A business domain can return to internal pilot. Rollback should not mean taking the whole platform offline. Fine-grained rollback preserves validated capability and reduces business disruption.

Change control also needs user communication. If a release changes default metrics, report format, or approval requirements, users need to know where the change happened, whether old results remain reviewable, and whether new results can be compared with old ones. For fixed processes such as operating reviews and finance retrospectives, the platform should keep a dual-track window where old and new definitions are visible, with one version marked for official material. This keeps DataAgent evolution from eroding trust in data definitions.

## 32.17 Acceptance order before expanding to a new business domain

When DataAgent expands from one business domain to another, teams should not copy prompts and report templates alone. Each domain has its own metric definitions, permission hierarchy, anomaly explanations, approval responsibility, and report audience. In sales, "region" may mean a sales organization. In supply chain, it may mean a warehouse and delivery network. In finance, it may map to an accounting entity. If the platform reuses the old domain's default dimensions and explanation style, users in the new domain will receive fluent but misaligned analysis.

Expansion should accept the semantic layer first, then querying, then analysis and reporting. Semantic-layer acceptance confirms core metrics, dimensions, definitions, default time grain, and permission boundary. Query acceptance confirms that NL2SQL reaches the right View, remains read-only, and handles empty results and permission refusal. Analysis acceptance confirms whether Python or statistical logic fits the domain. Report acceptance confirms EvidenceRef, human review, and publication boundary. This order prevents teams from skipping semantic foundations and asking the model to generate complete material too early.

Domain expansion should also preserve differences between the old and new domains. The release ledger should state which capabilities are reusable, which samples need rebuilding, which tools are added, and which report templates need rewriting. A capability verified only in the old domain should enter the new domain as a canary capability. Top-SKU decomposition in sales may not fit production-bottleneck analysis in manufacturing. An operating-review template may not fit a compliance explanation.

A first version can treat each new business domain as a small admission cycle. Admission material includes business questions, core metrics, permission roles, acceptance samples, failure handling, report template, and owner. After acceptance, the domain can open to more users. Before acceptance, it should provide only query or draft capability. This lets DataAgent coverage expand steadily without asking model generalization to absorb every business difference at once.

## 32.18 Responsibility map for the end-to-end DataAgent chain

The end-to-end DataAgent chain needs a responsibility map. After a natural-language question enters the system, it passes through semantic layer, query generation, execution engine, Python sandbox, chart generation, report expression, human review, and publication records. Each stage can succeed, fail, degrade, or wait. If responsibility is not assigned in advance, incidents are easily blamed on the model that produced the final answer, while the real issue may sit in data contracts, permissions, OLAP resources, or report templates.

The responsibility map should assign owners by chain stage. The semantic-layer owner handles metrics and field explanations. The data owner handles freshness and quality. The platform owner handles Runtime, Trace, and degradation. The security owner handles permissions and approval. The business owner handles acceptance samples and usage boundaries. Each owner needs observable signals: field version, quality state, SQL artifact, execution state, EvidenceRef, report version, and user feedback. Responsibility without signals rarely works in production.

The map should also support change. Adding a data domain, replacing a query engine, changing report templates, adjusting permissions, or adding human review changes one part of the responsibility chain. The responsibility map should update before the capability ships. DataAgent expansion then checks whether operating responsibility keeps pace with feature integration.

A first version can place the responsibility map inside the DataAgent release ledger. Each scenario lists chain stage, owner, evidence field, failure action, and review entry. Readers can then treat Chapters 33 to 36 as expansions of the responsibility map in Chapter 32, not separate feature modules.

## 32.19 DataAgent responsibility map

DataAgent spans data, models, tools, reports, and approvals, so a responsibility map matters more than a single architecture diagram. A wrong answer may come from semantic-layer definitions, SQL generation, permission filtering, Python analysis, report wording, cache, user context, or human review. Without a responsibility map, incidents bounce among data teams, model teams, and business teams.

The map should assign owners by chain segment. Semantic-layer owners maintain metric and dimension definitions. Data owners maintain source tables, quality, and permissions. Model platform owns routing and inference stability. Agent Runtime owns planning, tool calls, and state. The report layer owns EvidenceRef and publication boundaries. Business owners decide whether a conclusion fits the scenario. Security and compliance own high-risk actions and audit evidence. Each owner needs access to the relevant Trace segment.

A first version can maintain a responsibility matrix for each production DataAgent scenario. The matrix lists user entry point, key data sources, tools, models, approval points, report artifacts, SLO, and review owners. During incidents, teams first locate the responsibility domain through failure labels, then review samples. DataAgent then becomes an operable data-intelligence chain across teams, with question answering as one visible interaction.

## 32.20 Minimum evidence set for the DataAgent main chain

After the DataAgent main chain reaches production, a successful demo is not enough evidence. The platform needs stable fields for Question Frame, semantic match, SQL, execution result, analysis code, report artifact, and user feedback, and those fields should connect to release records, Trace, evaluation samples, and incident notes. When a production issue appears, teams can follow one set of facts to understand scope, ownership, and repair order instead of stitching together model logs, business logs, and verbal explanations.

This evidence also connects the surrounding chapters. It links to Chapters 33 through 36, Chapter 38 on Trace, and Chapter 39 on Eval: upstream capabilities provide assumptions, downstream capabilities consume the result, and governance capabilities preserve evidence and review decisions. If these materials do not share identifiers and versions, the production system splits apart. Business owners see user complaints, platform owners see system errors, and security or compliance teams see explanations written after the fact. That separation makes it hard to decide whether the issue came from data, model behavior, tool contracts, workflow state, or organizational ownership.

Common production risks include one step succeeding while the final answer remains unusable, reports that cannot trace back to SQL, and user edits that do not return to samples. These risks are less visible during demos because demos usually exercise the successful path. Production users bring boundary cases, repeated requests, permission changes, and long-running state. The platform team should turn such failures into release samples. Some samples should block launch, some can be handled by degradation, and some require the business owner to accept the remaining risk with a review date.

First-version DataAgent acceptance should inspect evidence completeness across the full chain instead of measuring only single-point capability. The record can stay compact, but it should include time, version, owner, sample, action, and the next review condition. Without those fields, review remains informal experience. With them, one production issue can become material for later releases, evaluation suites, and training.

A first platform version can start with a small set of high-risk paths. Choose flows with high traffic, high business impact, or sensitive data, require an evidence package for each change, and then expand the practice to ordinary scenarios. This keeps the capability at the engineering level: runnable, explainable, and recoverable.
## Chapter Recap

DataAgent covers more than NL2SQL. NL2SQL converts natural language into queries, while production DataAgent also handles semantic binding, read-only execution, Memory, analysis, reports, approval, and audit. ChatBI and BI Copilot focus more on query entry points and dashboard assistance; DataAgent targets cross-system, long-running, replayable data workflows. Querying, analysis, reporting, and task workbench should advance layer by layer. If the semantic layer is unstable, generating complete reports will amplify definition conflicts, permission gaps, and execution risk.

Question Frame is the intermediate contract that ties this chain together. It should enter Memory and checkpoints so later SQL, Python, chart, and report steps trace back to the same problem definition. DataAgent should reuse the data platform and Agent platform, including semantic layer, Registry, Runtime, Policy, Trace, and HITL. A standalone SQL plugin may be faster for a demo, but it scatters permission, audit, evaluation, and version management across separate implementations.
